Hello!

My name is William G Sternbach Jr, and I am a Java Developer!

I have been into software development for many years. Initially gaining interest in high school, I decided software was a 
great career for me. I now have a Bachelor's of Science from Western Governors University, and I'm currently pursuing a Master's of Business Administration at WGU. 
Go Night Owls!

I also love database development, and web development. That just means I love looking things up and putting them on the web!

If you are reading this, then hopefully we have the privilege of working together!

-- Will
